The Client file is suppose to run on your computer.

The server/index file is suppose to be on a server. But this was only tested on a rasberry pie.

## Start
To get started, run the server file first, then the client py. <br>
**MAKE SURE to `pip install` all the imports right** so that way you wont get errors. <br>

**FINALLY** you want to open the server ip, i suggest saving it somehwere so you dont have to keep scrolling.
